website
=============================

This repository hosts the Web page for the University of Maryland Libraries Coding Workshop.

Live pages are found in the gh-pages branch.

index.html is the home page

The home page is published at http://umd-coding-workshop.github.io/website/

You can edit using markdown by going to Settings -> Automatic Page Generator. You can also change the template there. **But** you will lose any changes you have made to the HTML so be careful. Or don't do that. Or save a copy of the HTML to put back when you're done.

More pages can be added as needed in the gh-pages branch.

For more on publishing pages using Github see http://pages.github.com/
