{"name":"UMD Libraries Coding Workshop","tagline":"Hacking the Shell","body":"### Welcome to the Coding Workshop\r\nThis group will serve as a gathering place for UMD library staff interested in computer programming. We will meet weekly to learn coding together, talk about code, and bounce ideas off each other. [CodeAcademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) will serve as a scaffolding for the workshop. Python is a popular language among hobbyists and real programmers alike for it's [what?].\r\n\r\nHalf of each weekly meeting will be devoted to working through CodeAcademy lessons together. Working through the exercises as a group will allow participants to ask others for help or talk about ideas that come up. In addition, the structure will hopefully serve as a motivating factor.\r\n\r\n### Why are we doing this?\r\nSee the links for better explanations but basically, coding is a good skill to have for three reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Given that so many library resources and tools are digital now, programming allows us to take a more active role in managing information resources, rather than simply being passive consumers. Coding allows you to build basic, artisanal tools that are useful to a small community, or even just you. A basic application that maybe doesn't warrant full-on IT support can sometimes be built \"out of the back of the garage\" to make your own job easier.\r\n2. A basic knowledge of code allows better communication with IT departments and vendors.\r\n3. Many library tools (Libguides, SFX, WorldcatUMD) can be customized, extended, or fixed by employing a bit of code.\r\n\r\n### Code in the Larger Library Universe\r\nA number of coding interest groups and resources have formed over the last couple years to support this kind of work. See links.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
