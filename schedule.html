<p>This group will serve as a gathering place for UMD library staff interested in computer programming. We will meet weekly to learn coding together, talk about code, and bounce ideas off each other. <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python">CodeAcademy's Python track</a> will serve as a scaffolding for the workshop. Python is a popular language among hobbyists and real programmers alike for it's [what?]. </p>

<p>Half of each weekly meeting will be devoted to working through CodeAcademy lessons together. Working through the exercises as a group will allow participants to ask others for help or talk about ideas that come up. In addition, the structure will hopefully serve as a motivating factor.</p>

<a name="why-are-we-doing-this" class="anchor" href="#why-are-we-doing-this"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why are we doing this?</h3>

<p>See the links for better explanations but basically, coding is a good skill to have for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Given that so many library resources and tools are digital now, programming allows us to take a more active role in managing information resources, rather than simply being passive consumers. Coding allows you to build basic, artisanal tools that are useful to a small community, or even just you. A basic application that maybe doesn't warrant full-on IT support can sometimes be built "out of the back of the garage" to make your own job easier. </li>
<li>A basic knowledge of code allows better communication with IT departments and vendors.</li>
<li>Many library tools (Libguides, SFX, WorldcatUMD) can be customized, extended, or fixed by employing a bit of code.</li>
</ol><h3>

<p>A number of coding interest groups and resources have formed over the last couple years to support this kind of work. See links.</p>
